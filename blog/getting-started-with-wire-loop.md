# Getting Started with Wire Loop

Welcome to Wire Loop, the ultimate precision-based game that will test your steady hands and patience!

## What is Wire Loop?

Wire Loop is a challenging game where you must navigate a cursor along a complex wire path without touching the wire itself. It's inspired by the classic steady-hand games you might have seen at carnivals or science museums.

## Basic Gameplay

1. **Start the Game**: Click or tap the green START point to begin
2. **Follow the Path**: Keep your mouse or finger pressed while following the wire
3. **Stay on Track**: Don't let go and don't touch the wire edges
4. **Reach the End**: Successfully navigate to the red END point

## Tips for Success

- **Take Your Time**: There's no time pressure, so move slowly and steadily
- **Use Smooth Movements**: Jerky motions are more likely to cause mistakes
- **Practice Makes Perfect**: Each level teaches you something new
- **Stay Calm**: If you fail, take a deep breath and try again

## Level Progression

The game features 8 challenging levels, each with increasing difficulty:

- **Levels 1-2**: Simple curves to get you started
- **Levels 3-4**: More complex patterns with tighter turns
- **Levels 5-6**: Advanced shapes with rapid direction changes
- **Levels 7-8**: Expert-level challenges for true masters

## Mobile vs Desktop

The game works on both desktop and mobile devices, but each has its advantages:

- **Desktop**: More precise control with a mouse
- **Mobile**: Touch interface with larger wire paths for better visibility

Good luck, and remember - patience is key!
