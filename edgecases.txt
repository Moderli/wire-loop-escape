# Wire Loop Game - Edge Cases Documentation

## 1. LEVEL LOADING AND DATA CORRUPTION
### Level Data Issues
- **Missing level files**: Game tries to load level that doesn't exist (e.g., level 9+)
- **Corrupted level data**: Level file exists but has malformed JSON/export structure
- **Empty wire path**: Level loads but wirePath array is empty []
- **Single point path**: Level has only one wire point, can't create a proper path
- **Invalid coordinates**: Wire points have NaN, Infinity, or null coordinates
- **Z-coordinate inconsistency**: Some points have z-values, others don't
- **Duplicate points**: Multiple identical coordinates causing zero-distance segments
- **Extreme coordinates**: Points with values beyond screen boundaries causing scaling issues

### Scaling and Projection Issues
- **Division by zero**: Path width or height is 0 causing scaling to fail
- **Negative dimensions**: Bounding box calculation results in negative width/height
- **Scale overflow**: Calculated scale is too large causing points to go off-screen
- **Precision loss**: Floating point arithmetic causing slight coordinate drift
- **Screen size edge cases**: Very small or very large screen sizes breaking calculations

## 2. GAME STATE MANAGEMENT
### State Transitions
- **Rapid state changes**: User clicks multiple buttons quickly causing race conditions
- **Invalid state combinations**: gameState='following' but gameStarted=false
- **Stuck in warning state**: Player gets stuck in warning mode indefinitely
- **State persistence**: Game state not properly reset between levels
- **Multiple game instances**: Two Phaser games running simultaneously

### Progress Tracking
- **Progress index overflow**: progressIndex exceeds smoothPoints array length
- **Negative progress**: progressIndex becomes negative due to calculation error
- **Progress jumping**: Player skips large sections of the path undetected
- **Progress reset fails**: progressIndex not properly reset when restarting level
- **Completion threshold**: Player reaches end but isn't detected as winning

## 3. INPUT AND COLLISION DETECTION
### Touch/Mouse Input Issues
- **Multi-touch interference**: Multiple fingers on screen causing confusion
- **Phantom touches**: Touch events firing without actual user input
- **Input lag**: High latency between input and response
- **Touch outside game area**: Clicks outside canvas affecting game state
- **Context menu interference**: Right-click menu blocking touch events

### Collision Detection Edge Cases
- **Tolerance variations**: Different devices having different collision tolerances
- **Fast movement detection**: Rapid mouse movement skipping over wire sections
- **Collision at corners**: Sharp turns in wire path causing false collision detection
- **Start point precision**: Player clicks near but not exactly on start point
- **Edge detection failure**: Player at exact edge of tolerance zone

### Smoothing and Path Generation
- **Catmull-Rom spline failures**: Invalid control points causing algorithm to break
- **Insufficient smoothing**: Too few smooth points causing jerky collision detection
- **Excessive smoothing**: Too many points causing performance issues
- **Spline overflow**: Generated points going far outside expected bounds
- **Segment calculation errors**: Distance-based segmentation producing invalid results

## 4. MOBILE AND ORIENTATION ISSUES
### Device Rotation
- **Orientation detection delay**: State changes before dimensions update
- **Landscape/portrait false detection**: Brief incorrect orientation readings
- **Rotation during gameplay**: User rotates device while actively playing
- **Orientation lock conflicts**: Browser/device orientation lock interfering
- **Mixed orientation states**: Different components thinking device is in different orientations

### Mobile-Specific Input
- **Touch precision variance**: Different finger sizes affecting accuracy
- **Touch delay/acceleration**: Hardware-specific touch response differences
- **Screen reader interference**: Accessibility tools interfering with touch events
- **Soft keyboard appearance**: Virtual keyboard changing screen dimensions
- **Pinch-zoom interference**: Accidental zoom gestures during gameplay

### Fullscreen Issues
- **Fullscreen permission denied**: Browser blocking fullscreen requests
- **Fullscreen exit during gameplay**: User exiting fullscreen unexpectedly
- **Multiple fullscreen requests**: Rapid clicking causing multiple requests
- **Fullscreen API differences**: Different browsers having different implementations
- **Fullscreen without user gesture**: Attempting fullscreen without user interaction

## 5. PERFORMANCE AND MEMORY ISSUES
### Memory Leaks
- **Event listener accumulation**: Not properly removing event listeners
- **Phaser game instances**: Multiple game instances not being destroyed
- **Graphics object buildup**: Graphics not being properly cleared/destroyed
- **Timeout/interval leaks**: Timers not being cleared on component unmount
- **Theme context leaks**: Event listeners not cleaned up properly

### Performance Degradation
- **Frame rate drops**: Complex levels causing performance issues
- **Memory pressure**: Long gameplay sessions causing memory issues
- **Battery drain**: Intensive graphics causing rapid battery consumption
- **Thermal throttling**: Device overheating affecting performance
- **Background tab performance**: Game continuing to run when tab not active

### Resource Loading
- **Failed texture generation**: Graphics.generateTexture() failing
- **Starfield particle overflow**: Too many particles being generated
- **Level caching issues**: Levels not properly cached between switches
- **Dynamic import failures**: Module loading failing at runtime

## 6. UI AND VISUAL ISSUES
### Rendering Problems
- **Canvas size mismatch**: Canvas dimensions not matching container
- **Z-index conflicts**: UI elements appearing behind/in front of game
- **Blur effect failures**: Post-processing pipeline not working on some devices
- **Graphics corruption**: Visual artifacts appearing during gameplay
- **HUD overlay issues**: Game HUD not properly positioned over game canvas

### Theme and Styling
- **Theme switching during gameplay**: Dark/light theme changes mid-game
- **CSS variable failures**: Theme variables not being applied correctly
